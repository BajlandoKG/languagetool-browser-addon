While LanguageTool is a vital extension for non-native speakers, it’s also smart enough to recognize mistakes that native speakers commonly make and it will improve your writing overall. This grammar and spelling correction works across all variations of common language; distinguishing between U.S. and British English, for instance. LanguageTool also features a personal dictionary for exceptions or words that you might commonly use but that are not found in a conventional dictionary. LanguageTool will recognize these words in future grammar checking and proofreading."
